# Frontend Post Order
A plugin to reorder posts via drag and drop on the frontend.

## Usage

Add the `[frontend_post_order]` shortcode where you'd like the list to be displayed.

By default only posts will be displayed. You can pass a type argument to the shortcode with a singular or comma separated list of post types which will output each of them on the frontend in their own lists.

**Example:**

`[frontend_post_order type="post, page, product"]`
